Below you will find the generic header our team uses for projects.
It differs from the generic header in that it does not include the name of
the file's creator. This is a remenant of one team member who aptly put it
"We all take credit for the successes and failures of the team." This
text should be placed in a plist file in:

[Project Folder] -> Workspace (Right click to view package contents) -> xcshareddata
(if the folder does not exist therein, create it)
(May also work to simply keep it somewhere in the project folder.)

And example of this plist file can also be found in the General App Setup folder.
(Note: the first line is actually above ___PACKAGENAME___
It includes only a single space because xcode will add // to the beginning of
the first line in the header. Include this line with just a space!)



//  ___PACKAGENAME___
//  ___FILEBASENAME___
//
//  Created on ___DATE___
//  Copyright (c) ___COPYRIGHT___ ___ORGANIZATIONNAME___
//
